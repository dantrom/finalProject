            <p class="summaries">User interviews are important because they offer valuable qualitative information from the viewpoint of someone who wasn't involved in the creation of the product. I asked questions about the users' backgrounds and then about their portfolio expectations.</p>

            <p class="summaries">A competitor analysis document reviews competing products and analyzes their features with the intention of comparing the competitors with the product in development. I reviewed profiles of a UX/UI designer, game developer, software engineer, and a web developer in order to gain a variety of perspectives from computer science and informatics.</p>

            <p class="summaries">I conducted a click test in order to learn where users thought my social media information would be in order to make sure it would be easy to locate when I add that feature. I also conducted a question test asking what users would expect to learn from the portfolio, what were some key omissions, and whether there were any confusing aspects to the site.</p>

            <h2> Summary of Findings </h2>
            <p class="summaries">
                The user interviews helped me establish a basis of what I should and shouldn't include in my portfolio. Everyone I talked to said that the experience and personal projects should be the cornerstone of the portfolio. The professor I talked to brought up a valid concern, which is that the portfolio must be frequently updated as to reflect the latest status in one's career. After the interviews, I conducted the competitor analysis which I thought was the most helpful part of my research. Seeing all the professional portfolios helped me understand which components are crucial for a successful portfolio. All of the portfolios followed the same basic structure which included personal information, projects, and contact details.
            </p>
            <p class="summaries">
                From the user interviews and competitor analysis, I was able to produce a feature value matrix and then a feature prioritization graphic. I tried to place the biggest items I was missing from my portfolio in comparison to the competitor portfolios. After this I began the user testing phase. The user stories helped me visualie use cases for the features on my portfolio. Then through the cognitive walkthrough I was able to view actual users navigating through my website. I appreciated the user tests portion of the research because I was able to see viewer's thoughts on what they expected to learn from the site, the key omissions that would be important to include in the future, and whether there were any confusing aspects of the site. Overwhelmingly users answered that they didn't find it confusing, but two answered that the intent of the site was not clear. Most users said I should include more information, and especially a resume.

            <h2> Incorporation of Findings </h2>
            <p class="summaries">
                I plan to add more bio content to the website. Currently, It just features my name, school, and major. After viewing the competitor portfolios I realized that this information is too minimal. I will Include more information about myself, projects that I have worked on, and relevant skills. Additionaly, I found that nearly every portfolio included social media links. I just currently have my email, so I want to add more channels for people to contact me. This will be easy to implement, as I already have a contact section, I just need to expand the content. Another feature I want to implement is providing more engaging images. The images I have now are all static and unenticing. I was drawn into one competitor's portfolio because they featured some images with interesting animations, and some that when you hovered the mouse cursor on them there would be a cool functionality, like a alternate picture.
            </p>
            <p class ="summaries">
                I also would like to make the website more interactive. Right now my only interactivity really is with the menu bar and its javascript functionality. Some of the portfolios I viewed had amazing interactivity, but I don't quite know yet how I'd implement additional interactivity. I'd need to learn more javascript and CSS probably in order to satisfy this goal. I might consider using a bootstrap theme, because using one would provide near instant results where the alternative is a few weeks or months of work spent in learning the languages more. An easy feaure I could implement is the addition of my resume, as that would just be text or a document. I arrived at these changes mainly through the competitor analysis, feature value matrix, and user tests.
